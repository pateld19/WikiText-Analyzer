===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*bʰuH-|*h₁es-|*h₂wes-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|been||to be}}. The various forms have three separate origins, which were mixed together at various times in the history of English.
* The forms beginning with ''b-'' come from {{inh|en|ang|bēon||to be, become}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*beuną||to be, exist, come to be, become}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*bʰúHt||to grow, become, come into being, appear}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*bʰuH-}}. In particular:<!--moved from [[been]]-->
** Now-dialectal use of ''been'' as an infinitive of ''be'' is either from {{inh|en|enm|been|t=to be}} or an extension of the past participle.
** Now-obsolete use of ''been'' as a plural present tense (meaning "are") is from {{inh|en|enm|been}}, {{m|enm|be}} (present plural of {{m|enm|been|t=to be}}, with the ''-n'' leveled in from the past and subjunctive; compare competing forms {{m|enm|aren}}/{{m|enm|are}}).
** Use of ''been'' as a past participle is from {{inh|en|enm|been|}}, {{m|enm|ybeen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|ġebēon}}.
* The forms beginning with ''w-'' come from the aforementioned {{inh|en|ang|bēon}}, which shared its past tense with the verb {{m|ang|wesan}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wesaną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₂wes-||to reside}}.
* The remaining forms are also from {{inh|en|ang|wesan||to be}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*wesaną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₁ésti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*h₁es-}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* When used copulatively with a pronoun, traditional grammar puts the pronoun in the [[subjective case]] ({{m|en||I}}, {{m|en||he}}, {{m|en||she}}, {{m|en||we}}, {{m|en||they}}) rather than the [[objective case]] ({{m|en||me}}, {{m|en||him}}, {{m|en||her}}, {{m|en||us}}, {{m|en||them}}), regardless of which side of the copula it is placed. For example, “''I was the masked man''” and “''The masked man was I''” would both be considered correct, while “''The masked man was me''” and “''Me was the masked man''” would both be incorrect. However, most colloquial speech treats the verb ''be'' as transitive, in which case the pronoun is used in the objective case if it occurs after the copula: “''I was the masked man''” but “''The masked man was me''”. This paradigm applies even if the copula is linking two pronouns; thus “''I am her''” and “''She is me''", and “''Am I me?''” (versus the traditional “''I am she''”, “''She is I''”, “''Am I I?''”). However, the use of ''whom'' with a copula is generally considered incorrect and a [[hypercorrection]], though in some cases (especially in sentences involving a [[to-infinitive]] or a perfect tense), such as “''Whom do you want to be?''”, it can come naturally to some speakers; in short, straightforward sentences, such as “''Whom are you?''”, this is much rarer and likelier to be considered incorrect.
* Except senses 12 (auxiliary forming the passive voice), 13 (auxiliary forming the continuous aspect) and 22 (dynamic or lexical ''be''), this is generally a [[stative verb]] that rarely takes the continuous aspect. See [[:Category:English stative verbs]].

* The verb {{m|en||be}} is the most irregular non-defective verb in Standard English. Unlike other verbs, which distinguish at most five forms (as in {{m|en||do}}–{{m|en||does}}–{{m|en||doing}}–{{m|en||did}}–{{m|en||done}}), {{m|en||be}} distinguishes many more:
** {{m|en||Be}} itself is the plain form, used as the infinitive, as the imperative, and as the present subjunctive (though many speakers do not distinguish the present indicative and present subjunctive, using the indicative forms for both).
**:: ''I want to '''be''' a father someday.'' (infinitive)
**:: ''If that '''be''' true...'' (present subjunctive; ''is'' is common in this position)
**:: ''Allow the truth to '''be''' heard!'' (infinitive)<!--As it stood, "Let the truth be heard", it could have been interpreted just as validly as a subjunctive. This version eliminates the ambiguity.-->
**:: ''Please '''be''' here by eight o’clock.'' (imperative)
**:: ''The librarian asked that the rare books not '''be''' touched.'' (present subjunctive; speakers that do not distinguish the subjunctive and indicative would use an [[auxiliary verb]] construction here)
**: {{senseid|en|dynamic conjugation}}{{m|en||Be}} is also used as the present tense indicative form in the alternative, dynamic / lexical conjugation of ''be'':
**:: ''What do we do? We '''be''' ourselves.'' (first-person plural present indicative, lexical be)
**:: but: ''Who '''are''' we? We '''are''' human beings.'' (first-person plural present indicative, copula be)
**: It is also an archaic alternative form of the indicative, especially in the plural:<ref>{{cite-book|author=Goold Brown|authorlink=Goold Brown|chapter=Of Verbs|title=The Grammar of English Grammars,{{nb...|with an Introduction, Historical and Critical; the Whole Methodically Arranged and Amply Illustrated; with Forms of Correcting and of Parsing, Improprieties for Correction, Examples for Parsing, Questions for Examination, Exercises for Writing, Observations for the Advanced Student, Decisions and Proofs for the Settlement of Disputed Points, Occasional Strictures and Defences, an Exhibition of the Several Methods of Analysis, and a Key to the Oral Exercises: to Which Are Added Four Appendixes, Pertaining Separately to the Four Parts of Grammar}}|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher={{...|Published by}}Samuel S. & William Wood,{{nb...|No. 261 Pearl Street}}|year=1851|page=357|pageurl=https://archive.org/details/grammarofenglish00browrich/page/357/mode/1up}}.</ref>

**: '''''Am''' I in the right place?'' (first-person singular present indicative)
**: ''You '''are''' even taller than your brother!'' (second-person singular present indicative)
**: ''Where '''is''' the library?'' (third-person singular present indicative)
**: ''These '''are''' the biggest shoes we have.'' (plural present indicative)
** {{m|en|was|Was}} and {{m|en|were}} are the forms of the past indicative and past subjunctive (like {{m|en||did}}). In the past indicative, {{m|en||was}} is the first- and third-person singular (used with {{m|en||I}}, as well as with {{m|en||he}}, {{m|en||she}}, {{m|en||it}} and other subjects that would be used with {{m|en||does}} rather than {{m|en||do}}), and {{m|en||were}} is both the second-person singular and the plural (used with {{m|en||we}}, {{m|en||you}}, {{m|en||they}}, and any other plural subjects). In the traditional past subjunctive, {{m|en||were}} is used with all subjects, though many speakers do not actually distinguish the past subjunctive from the past indicative, and therefore use {{m|en||was}} with first- and third-person singular subjects even in cases where other speakers would use {{m|en||were}}.
**: ''I '''was''' out of town.'' (first-person singular past indicative)
**: ''You '''were''' the first person here.'' (second-person singular past indicative)
**: ''The room '''was''' dirty.'' (third-person singular past indicative)
**: ''We '''were''' angry at each other.'' (plural past indicative)
**: ''I wish I '''were''' more sure.'' (first-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also common, though considered less correct by some)
**: ''If she '''were''' here, she would know what to do.'' (third-person singular past subjunctive; ''was'' is also common, though considered less correct by some)
** {{m|en|being|Being}} is the gerund and present participle, used in progressive aspectual forms, after various [[Appendix:English catenative verbs|catenative]] verbs, and in other constructions that function like nouns, adjectivally or adverbially. (It’s also used as a deverbal noun and as a conjunction; see those senses in the entry for {{m|en|being}} itself.)
**: '''''Being''' in London and '''being''' in Tokyo have similar rewards but in different languages.'' (gerund in grammatical subject)
**: ''All of a sudden, he’s '''being''' nice to everyone.'' (present participle in progressive aspect)
**:''His mood '''being''' good increased his productivity noticeably.'' (present participle in adjectival phrase)
**: ''It won’t stop '''being''' a problem until someone does something about it.'' (gerund after catenative verb)
** {{m|en|been|Been}} is the past participle, used in the perfect aspect. In Middle English, it was also the infinitive.
**: ''It’s '''been''' that way for a week and a half.''
* In archaic or obsolete forms of English, with the pronoun {{m|en|thou}}, the verb {{m|en||be}} has a few additional forms:
** When the pronoun {{m|en||thou}} was in regular use, the forms {{m|en|art}}, {{m|en|wast}}, and {{m|en|wert}} were the corresponding present indicative, past indicative, and past subjunctive, respectively.
** As {{m|en||thou}} became less common and more highly marked, a special present-subjunctive form {{m|en|beest}} developed (replacing the regular present subjunctive form {{m|en||be}}, still used with all other subjects). Additionally, the form {{m|en||wert}}, previously a past subjunctive form, came to be used as a past indicative as well.
* The forms {{m|en||am}}, {{m|en||is}}, and {{m|en||are}} can contract with preceding subjects: {{m|en|I'm|I’m|I am}}, {{m|en|'s|’s|is}}, {{m|en|'re|’re|are}}. The form {{m|en||are}} most commonly contracts with personal pronouns ({{m|en|we're|we’re|we are}}, {{m|en|you're|you’re|you are}}, {{m|en|they're|they’re|they are}}), but contractions with other subjects are possible; the form {{m|en||is}} contracts quite freely with a variety of subjects. These contracted forms, however, are possible only when there is an explicit, non-preposed complement, and they cannot be stressed; therefore, contraction does not occur in sentences such as the following:
*: ''Who’s here? —I '''am'''.''
*: ''I wonder what it '''is'''.''
*: ''I don’t want to be involved. —But you '''''are''''' involved, regardless.''
* Several of the finite forms of {{m|en||be}} have special negative forms, containing the suffix {{m|en|-n't|-n’t}}, that can be used instead of adding the adverb {{m|en|not}}. Specifically, the forms {{m|en||is}}, {{m|en||are}}, {{m|en||was}}, and {{m|en||were}} have the negative forms {{m|en|isn't|isn’t}}, {{m|en|aren't|aren’t}}, {{m|en|wasn't|wasn’t}}, and {{m|en|weren't|weren’t}}. The form {{m|en||be}} itself does not, even in finite uses, with “not be” being used in the present subjunctive and “do not be” or “don’t be” (or, in dated use, “be not”) being used in the imperative. The form {{m|en||am}} has the negative forms {{m|en|aren't|aren’t}}, {{m|en|amn't|amn’t}}, and {{m|en|ain't|ain’t}}, but all of these are in restricted use; see their entries for details.
* Outside of Standard English, there is some variation in usage of some forms; some dialects, for example, use {{m|en||is}} or {{m|en||’s}} throughout the present indicative (supplanting, in whole or in part, {{m|en||am}} and {{m|en||are}}), and/or {{m|en||was}} throughout the past indicative and past subjunctive (supplanting {{m|en||were}}).
